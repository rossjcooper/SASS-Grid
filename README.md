# Super-Simple-SASS-Grid

A basic grid written in SASS with simple breakpoints to get started with responsiveness.

## Installation

Clone or download either the .scss file, or include the complied and minified .css files straight into your HTML.

## Usage

The grid is relatively flexible and doesn't really enforce any rules or structure.
Although  I do advice putting column divs (e.g. .third) inside .row elements but this is not required.
The .container class is used for page or content containers that don't quite go full-width, the width: property is designed to be adjuested to your needs.
